# HSS (Humber Sports Statistics)

A website where visitors can see stats for different teams 
and players in the English Premier League. What will make our website unique is 
that instead of goals and assists, we will display advanced stats like efficiency and 
other uncommon stats in soccer. Targeted audience are people who watch the English Premier League, sports bettors 
and scouts.
